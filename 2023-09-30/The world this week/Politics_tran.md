Tens of thousands of ethnic Armenians fled, a disputed Armenian-majority enclave in Azerbaijan that the Azeri army has taken control of. Azerbaijan’s president, Ilham Aliyev, promised to protect ethnic Armenians, but said that Karabakh’s decades-long status as an independent entity was over. At least 68 people were killed by an explosion at a fuel depot. The episode underlines the waning of Russian influence in the Caucasus. Armenia, long an ally of Russia, is pivoting towards the West. America said the Azeri show of force was unacceptable and told Azerbaijan to observe a ceasefire and allow aid into the area. 
 president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, met Mr Aliyev to discuss the crisis and to hail the Azeri victory. Separately, Mr Erdogan reiterated his pledge to ratify  membership of NATO if America sells F-16 fighter jets to Turkey.  president, Viktor Orban, the other hold out on confirming Sweden’s membership, said he was in no hurry to ratify.

Kosovo said the men were “Serbian state-supported troops” and that some had fled to Serbia. 
 special forces claimed to have killed dozens of Russian naval officers in a missile attack on Russian headquarters in Sevastopol, Crimea’s biggest port.

Meanwhile the first American-made M1 Abrams tanks arrived in Ukraine to help with its counter-offensive against the Russians.
A UN commission of inquiry on Ukraine said that Russia had  people to death in areas it had occupied, and that Russian soldiers had raped or committed sexual violence against women ranging in age from 19 to 83. Russia denies targeting civilians. 
 conservative leader, Alberto Núñez Feijóo, narrowly failed to get enough votes in the lower house of parliament to become prime minister. His People’s Party won the most seats in an election in July, but he could not persuade smaller parties to give him an absolute majority. Spanish law allows him a second attempt on September 29th.
