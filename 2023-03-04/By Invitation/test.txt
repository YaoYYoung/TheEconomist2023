In the hour-long video footage of his death, viewers could see the officers fail to use basic policing tactics such as control holds, takedowns and command co-ordination. Instead, they used force incompetently, ineffectively and brutally. Their actions, and the ethical failures underlying them, appear to stem from a lack of training. This is a widespread problem in American policing. And because police have a unique mandate—they can use force, even deadly force, in the public interest—it demands a unique solution. \nOne of us is a criminologist and former police officer; the other is a sociologist and serving officer. We have each spent more than a decade conducting academic studies of officer performance, de-escalation training and use-of-force incidents. We know that deadly incidents like the one in Memphis are rare. But we also know that police suffer from a huge lack of training in what are known as “defensive tactics”, or “arrest-and-control techniques”. Our research shows that, contrary to the public’s belief that police recruits tend to be aggressive, new officers often struggle in violent situations. One of our studies found that roughly one-third of patrol officers felt ill-prepared to safely control resisting suspects (meaning to take them to the ground and get them in handcuffs), and almost one-third had themselves been injured when they used force.\nWe know, of course, that not all indefensible uses of force stem from a lack of training. Some officers are too aggressive and some lack self-control. Better training can help blunt the effects of those traits, whereas poor training may enhance them. And we know, too, not just from our own work but from broader studies of human performance in multiple disciplines, that the time dedicated to training officers at present is insufficient. \nIn California, where one of us works as a police sergeant, officers are required to receive “psychomotor” training only once every two years for 12 hours. Four of those 12 go to firearms training, four to use-of-force training and four to defensive tactics. This is a sadly typical schedule. Imagine if surgeons required only 60 hours of training—the amount California requires for new recruits’ defensive-tactic training—in surgery in medical school and then four hours of continuing education every two years.\nBut what training works best? Police training, which is usually received in purpose-built academies, currently suffers from excessive reliance on tradition and received wisdom. Other industries, including medicine, aviation and professional sports, have devoted time, energy and money to figuring out what expert performance looks like and how it can be taught and replicated—for instance, why some nurses are better able to detect crises than others, and how and why pilots make errors in flight. They have harnessed science and data in these pursuits; police departments, by and large, have not. \nBut these other occupations have generous corporate or government funding streams. When compared with those streams, or with the part of the defence department’s budget dedicated to understanding and improving soldiers’ decision-making and performance, federal, state and local funding for police training is minuscule. Meeting the public’s high expectations will be expensive.  \nGovernments will need to increase training budgets, but police departments will also need to rethink how they train officers. Too often training is in separate silos. Skills for physical control and emotional control—the communication-based tactic commonly referred to as “de-escalation”—are taught separately. Officers learn the latter in a one-day session with a curriculum focused on enhancing empathy, among other things. But real-world situations often demand both physical and emotional control; integrating skills in real time, without adequate forethought, is fiendishly difficult.\nFortunately, psychologists such as Anders Ericsson, Joan Vickers and Gary Klein, who have studied human performance, developed a model for such integrative training, known as “deliberate practice”. It centres on real-world examples presented in physically and cognitively realistic situations. Trainees participate in a large volume of repetitive exercises, but they also receive consistent, structured feedback on process and outcomes. For example, athletes simulate game situations, with coaches reviewing their technical performance after each exercise. The coaches gradually increase the simulations’ difficulty and variability to push athletes to adapt their skills. Similar techniques have been used to teach nurses neonatal resuscitation. It all turns on the choice of movements and decisions in a training environment that rewards speed in making increasingly complex judgments. \nTraining will need to become more like athletic coaching, in which trainers put individual officers through their paces based on the officers’ unique personal needs. While classroom time need not disappear entirely, it should involve written scenarios or camera footage to link important concepts and perceptual judgments to a range of scenarios. Out-of-classroom training should require role-playing scenarios and immersive simulation. Departments will have to hire more officers—and governments will need to increase agencies’ budgets—to ensure there are enough police to remain consistently visible in communities even as more officers spend more time in training. Police will need to see their continuing education not as punishment or mandatory, box-ticking drudgery, but as essential to staying effective. That means agencies will need to start celebrating expert performance, instead of just punishing errors. \nWhat we’ve described above is daunting. Liberal states and cities will need to face down their critics on the left, and explain why they are not just increasing police budgets and department sizes but also training police to use force more effectively. Conservative states and cities will need to embrace increased empathy and de-escalation training. Officers will need to learn how to view training as helpful, not onerous. All of these changes will be difficult. But expecting expert performance from poorly trained officers is unrealistic. It imperils the safety of officers and the public they serve, and will result in more avoidable situations like the recent tragedy in Memphis.■\n_______________\nBrian Lande is chief science officer at Polis Solutions, a company that develops training, research and technology for law-enforcement agencies in America, and is a police sergeant in northern California.
