The American government tightened its ban on selling chips to China for use in , extending the rules to capture sales of chips that had previously fallen just outside the ban’s technical parameters. The clampdown is bad news for , which said that the new restrictions would apply to its H800 AI chip. Chinese tech companies have been rushing to buy up the modified chip in case of a prohibition. Meanwhile, Nvidia announced a partnership with , a Taiwanese manufacturer, to build data centres powered by Nvidia’s technology. 
The race for dominance in AI was thrown into focus when  announced that its ERNIE 4 chatbot was now as good as OpenAI’s GPT-4. The Chinese tech giant showed off ERNIE’s capabilities at an event in Beijing by getting it to complete tasks, such as writing a martial-arts novel. ERNIE has 45m users, a fraction of ChatGPT’s 180m, though the American bot was launched several months earlier.

  was 4.9% larger in the third quarter than in the same period a year ago, a faster pace of growth than analysts had forecast. September’s growth in industrial output and retail sales also beat expectations. Officials downplayed talk of an economic recovery, warning that “the external environment is becoming more complex.” The property market is very fragile, as speculation mounts that , the country’s biggest developer, may have defaulted on its dollar debt. 
Britain’s annual  rate held steady in September, at 6.7%. Food prices rose at the slowest pace since June 2022. The core rate, which excludes energy and food, eased to 6.1%. The Bank of England left interest rates on hold at its most recent meeting, and markets are betting it will do so again. “Let’s not get carried away,” Andrew Bailey, the bank’s governor, has said; the fight against inflation is not over. 
Net income at  fell again in the third quarter, the eighth consecutive quarter of declining profit. The bank made $1.9bn, down by 36% compared with the same period last year.
