The  worsened in Gaza, where about 3,500 people have been killed, according to the Palestinians, amid Israel’s retaliation for the Hamas attack. Under mounting international pressure, Israel will allow food, water and medicine to cross from Egypt to southern Gaza, where the population has moved to take shelter. King Abdullah of Jordan warned that the “region is on the brink of falling into the abyss”, but was adamant that his country and Egypt would not accept refugees. 
Israel’s ground troops were poised to enter Gaza. They have been held back in part because of fears that , a powerful militia based in Lebanon, will launch a big assault across the border into northern Israel at the moment when Israeli soldiers are focused on Gaza.

Inthe liberal Civic Coalition and its allies won enough seats at an election to form a majority in parliament, heralding a big shift in government. The conservative Law and Justice (PiS) party, a thorn in the EU’s side since gaining power in 2015, came first but will struggle to rule, even with the support of a far-right party. It is expected to get the first stab at forming a government; talks could take weeks. Donald Tusk, the leader of the Civic Coalition, called on the country’s PiS-allied president to swiftly start the process. 
 has used long-range  for the first time, according to Volodymyr Zelensky, the country’s president.

The referendum on the Voice, as it was dubbed, was beaten by 61% to 39% and failed in all six Australian states.

The centre-right National Party won  general election, ending the six-year rule of the Labour Party, formerly led by Jacinda Ardern. Christopher Luxon, the incoming prime minister, will form a coalition with the ACT party, which is classically liberal.

Pro-democracy campaigners in  were outraged by the decision of the Constitutional Court to add an exception to a law that bars people under the age of 40 from running for president.

UN peacekeepers in  are struggling to leave the country by the end of the year, as agreed, because of a rapid deterioration in security that is preventing it from retrieving equipment. Some 300 blue helmets have been killed over the course of the ten-year-long mission.
Daniel Noboa was elected as president. The 35-year-old businessman is a centrist who has promised to reduce crime, the big issue during the election.

Pepper X was named as the world’s  by Guinness World Records. The previous record was held by the Carolina Reaper. Both are grown by Ed Currie (no pun intended), a farmer from South Carolina.
