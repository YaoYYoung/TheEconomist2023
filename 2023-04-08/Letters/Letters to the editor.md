Factors in life expectancy
You reported on the decline in life expectancy in Britain (“”, March 11th). However, this is not a story of a failed health system. Rather it is a story of success driven by drug development and health care over the past 40 years. Premature mortality decreased from the 1990s to the 2010s, primarily because of improvements in cardiovascular treatment. This decrease plateaued in the 2010s, not because of a failure in medicine and social structures, but because, given patient adherence levels, maximum efficiency was reached.
The reduction in child mortality over the four decades to the 2010s can be explained mostly by improved road safety, suffocation risk-reduction measures (inhalation holes in plastic bags, pen lids and toys), and leaps forward in the treatment of haematological cancers and childhood neoplasms more broadly. Medical science continues to reduce childhood mortality and will cut deaths from disease in children to below the figure of seven per 100,000 in Britain in 2020.
Modern medicine is not a panacea. With over three times as many people in deprived areas still smoking compared with higher income areas, and most Britons becoming overweight or obese in their 20s onwards, we know there are health consequences to our life-style choices as adults.

Improving the lifespan means that ageing becomes an opportunity, not a cost. People work longer, spend more, volunteer and provide care. In countries such as Canada, where 6% of health spending goes on prevention, there are lasting and significant impacts. Across the G20, increasing preventative health spending by just 0.1% could unlock a 9% increase in annual spending by people aged 60 and over. We are at risk of heading in the wrong direction. In Britain spending to help people stop smoking has been reduced, yet fewer smoking-related diseases would boost the British economy by as much as £19bn ($23bn) a year. There is a clear economic argument as well as a moral one for committing to longer lives for all.

Future of the Chagos Islands
Simon Jackson wonders why Mauritius is keen to obtain the Chagos Islands (, March 18th). These islands have always been part of Mauritius. In the Lancaster House Agreement of 1965 Britain promised to return them to Mauritius when they were no longer needed for defence purposes. Neither the Seychelles nor the Maldives have any historical links to, or have ever made a claim to, Chagos, even if the archipelago is closer to their shores. But then the Channel Islands are much closer to France than Britain. 
Mauritius is committed to the American base remaining on Diego Garcia and has offered a 99-year lease and also to facilitate and finance the resettlement of Chagossians who wish to return. Mauritius also supports the continuation of a marine protected area. 
An overall settlement is the purpose of the current negotiations between Britain and Mauritius, which America and the Chagos Islands All-party Parliamentary Group fully support. Both governments expect to conclude an agreement within the coming months. Britain can no longer ignore resolutions at the UN General Assembly and the rulings of international courts, nor the opprobrium that its unlawful occupation of the Chagos conveys.

The Fed’s policy choices
Your article suggesting that the Federal Reserve must choose between inflation and financial stability (“”, March 19th, digital editions) underestimates the importance of the central bank’s new liquidity facility, the Bank Term Funding Programme. As you point out, many banks hold mark-to-market losses as a result of rising interest rates. The new facility puts a floor on those losses for up to a year by lending at par values, in effect providing amnesty to banks with sufficient Treasury holdings. And you are right that the broader economy can shoulder higher rates, and few banks are as brazen in risk control as those that have floundered. 
The Fed doesn’t need to prevent all losses for banks indefinitely—it just needs to provide time and a safety net for those banks to adjust to a changing environment. The new liquidity facility does just that. With its short-term rate-insurance policy, the Fed indeed can walk and chew gum at the same time.

Crooked car washes
Our organisation, set up by the Church of England to fight modern slavery, is all too familiar with the exploitative hand-car-wash businesses that Bagehot described (). The police do intervene when extreme cases are discovered, but as exploitation occurs on a sliding scale it often goes undetected. There are thousands of businesses that do not treat their workers properly. Many workers don’t have the appropriate protective gear, or are under age or live on site in poor conditions. Sometimes they are paid next to nothing and face a variety of other unsafe, unfair and controlling practices.
To try to identify exploitative businesses in the hand-car-wash sector, we have developed the Safe Car Wash App. We would urge readers to download the app and use it whenever they visit a hand car-wash. By doing this they can help law-enforcement agencies free victims of modern slavery and exploitation. We would also encourage policymakers, as Bagehot suggests, to start taking seriously the need to crack down on law-breaking businesses before more lives are ruined.

Thrown out of the club
Brian Olney pointed out your excessive use of “a club of mostly rich countries” to describe the OECD (, March 25th). He was being too kind. The phrase is inaccurate and insipid. “Mostly rich” does not describe Luxembourg; “blessedly rich” would be more like it. Should the countries that do not fall under the definition of “mostly rich” be asked to leave? And why use the somewhat disparaging “club”? Do OECD members sit around in upholstered chairs in some stuffy Victorian building in the West End of London?

We fry our best
As I read your article on America’s egg business my hopes gradually rose that you would avoid the yoke/joke pun (“”, March 18th). Alas, “it is no yolk!” concluded the final sentence. I was beaten, my mood cracked, my equanimity scrambled. But I appreciate your hard-boiled journalism too much and I will continue to shell out for my weekly copy.
