America’s Justice Department sued  for anticompetitive behaviour in online advertising. The suit alleges that Google tried to limit its rivals’ access to digital-ad technology by acquiring firms that develop it and wielded its dominance in the market to force advertisers and publishers to use its products.

In an indication of shareholder frustration at the strategic direction of some tech firms, , a prolific Wall Street activist hedge fund, has reportedly taken a stake in , one of the world’s biggest software companies.

Reed Hastings stepped down as chief executive of , which he helped found in 1997 as a DVD rental firm. He’ll remain at the company as executive chairman.

The publishing and entertainment businesses were split in 2013 (21st Century Fox, the film studio, was subsequently sold to Disney).

A German union said that  is planning to cut 3,200 jobs and move some activities to America. The carmaker has not confirmed the cuts, saying only that it needs to make structural changes amid the shift to electric vehicles.

 took the stand at his trial for securities fraud in relation to a spurious tweet in 2018 about taking Tesla private. Mr Musk insisted he had never intended to mislead investors and “would be sad” if some had lost money as a result of the market reaction to the tweet.
