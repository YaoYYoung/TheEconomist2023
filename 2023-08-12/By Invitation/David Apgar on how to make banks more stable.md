THE THREE big American bank failures this year, set to cost the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation an eye-watering $35bn, were all, in their own way, one-off misadventures. Silicon Valley Bank had  under control, but there’s no guaranteeing the price of long-term bonds when interest rates rise—a problem when you hold $91bn of them. Signature Bank was no more typical: most banks don’t owe 30% of their deposits to cryptocurrency companies. First Republic was an outlier in a different way, with 68% of its deposits above the federal-insurance limit.
The very fact that all three banks were so different points to a systemic problem. Modern finance is underpinned by so-called fractional-reserve banking. Working on the assumption that not all depositors will want their money back at once, banks keep only a fraction of their (mostly short-term) deposits on hand, channelling much of the rest into (mostly long-term) loans. This fuels credit to enterprising businesses, but it makes banks vulnerable to runs, and the financial system therefore less stable.
The theoretical antidote to fractional reserve banking—so-called narrow banking—dates back 90 years to the “Chicago Plan”, proposed by a group of economists at the University of Chicago. With the Depression fresh in mind, they suggested requiring banks to hold 100% cash reserves against deposits. This would separate the monetary and credit functions of the banking system, making banks, in essence, branches of the Federal Reserve. Narrow banks would hold no loans that could go bad. Institutions that continued to lend would lose access to government-insured deposits from savers. But at least their investors, lacking that insurance, would force them to pay attention to risk and be ready to take losses.
A perennial complaint against narrow banking—and a reason it didn’t take off—is that it seems to nationalise credit markets. But it is better seen as privatising lending. You might say narrow banks nationalise, or at least centralise, deposit-taking. Then again, so does any banking system with broad government-backed deposit insurance.
But narrow banking has more serious flaws. Narrow banks are unable to transform the on-demand deposits that most savers prefer into the long-term credit that businesses and homeowners need. Long-term credit could not exceed the amount of savings bonds and other long-term savings. Moreover, lenders would still be vulnerable to runs from uninsured investors who lose confidence in them. A more technical concern is that central banks can’t directly encourage or discourage lending in a system with strictly narrow banks—monetary policy loses force. In other words, narrow banking immunises banks that embrace it against runs and does away with the need for deposit insurance, but at a high cost.
There are, though, ways to bring the cost down. One is to create banks that are narrower than today’s, but not fully narrow. For instance, banks could be allowed to lend, but only to other lenders. Those other lenders would be uninsured, as in the case of very narrow banking. And they would probably be smaller and more local than the insured deposit-takers, given the economics of credit analysis; economies of scale are not as important in lending as in deposit-taking. But here, insured banks would lend against specific loan pools or lending programmes (for instance, mortgages in a specific area). They would take a “senior” 85-90% stake in each pool or programme, incurring losses only if riskier stakes were wiped out. The local lenders, in other words, would bear most of the credit risk in the loans they make.
The narrowish banks would still face some risks that the very narrow banks envisioned by the Chicago Plan wouldn’t: interest-rate risk, for one, since the typical maturity of their part of loan pools would be longer-term than on-demand deposits. And they would still have some credit risk since losses on a pool might be greater than the lender’s stake.
But narrowish banks avoid some of the problems of fully narrow ones. They could supply long-term credit well in excess of long-term savings. Credit for local lenders—and so also for their borrowers—would be relatively stable since their risk profiles would be much easier to grasp than those of individuals. And monetary policy would still work.
An overlooked advantage of narrow banks is their impact on competition. Since depositors want the stability and reliability of banks that stretch across regions—and are thus less exposed to local shocks—nationally active insured institutions would jostle to attract savings. Without exotic new classes of borrowers to distract them, they would have to compete more keenly on service.
And there would be a diverse array of uninsured lenders in the market to give borrowers access to a wide range of views on their creditworthiness. Having to serve two constituencies—depositors and borrowers—is one reason today’s banks are less nimble than securities firms and brokerages. They’re like the adults who struggle in three-legged races at the county fair as their kids race down the sidelines.
Why, then, don’t banks just get narrower on their own? The reason is that the transition would require co-ordination from regulators. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which oversees American banks with a charter to operate nationwide, took a stab at that problem in 1995. The idea was to give deposit-taking specialists access to bank examiners’ assessments of lenders’ underwriting quality in order to facilitate bank funding for lenders in a narrowish-banking scenario. There are ways to do this without disclosing the overall quality of their loans.
Alas, other, necessary disclosures would shed light on the quality of the examiners’ assessments. That might be good public policy. But the scheme couldn’t hope for support from the examiners on whom it depended, and it died on the vine.
It nevertheless remains a viable option. Which is a good thing, because you never know what turbulence the next credit cycle will bring with fractional-reserve banking.■
