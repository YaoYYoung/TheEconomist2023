America’s   as speaker, the first time in history someone has been ousted from the job. His downfall was initiated by Matt Gaetz, a far-right congressman, after Mr McCarthy secured the passage of a last-minute bill to avoid a government shutdown with Democratic support (the bill keeps the government functioning only until November 17th). Mr Gaetz said it was a sell-out. In the ballot that decided Mr McCarthy’s fate a handful of rebellious Republicans joined the Democrats to fire him. 
California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, appointed Laphonza Butler to the  seat left vacant by the death of Dianne Feinstein.

He has pledged to stop sending arms to Ukraine. 
The European Union’s foreign ministers held a meeting in Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital, the first time they have gathered in a non-EU country.

Cancelled departure
Rishi Sunak, Britain’s prime minister, announced that the leg of a high-speed rail project connecting Birmingham to Manchester will be scrapped.

Jihadists in killed at least 29 soldiers, the militants’ deadliest attack since a coup in July.
