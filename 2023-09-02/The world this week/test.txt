Now, advances in generative artificial intelligence—with models that can spit out sophisticated essays and create realistic images from text prompts—make synthetic propaganda possible.

Vladimir Putin claims that Ukraine is a NATO puppet, whose Nazi cliques threaten Russia; India’s ruling party warns that Muslims are waging a “love jihad” to seduce Hindu maidens. Preachers of paranoid nationalism harm the targets of their rhetoric, obviously, but their real intention is to hoodwink their own followers. By inflaming nationalist fervour, self-serving leaders can more easily win power and, once in office, they can distract public attention from their abuses by calling out the supposed enemies who would

By inflaming nationalist fervour, self-serving leaders can more easily win power and, once in office, they can distract public attention from their abuses by calling out the supposed enemies who would otherwise keep them in check.","textHtml":"In Europe, the Middle East and Africa we consider how paranoid nationalism corrupts. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAround the world cynical leaders are using a mix of exaggeration and lies to win and abuse power. Vladimir Putin claims that Ukraine is a \u003csmall\u003eNATO\u003c/small\u003e puppet, whose Nazi cliques threaten Russia; India’s ruling party warns that Muslims are waging a “love jihad” to seduce Hindu maidens. Preachers of paranoid nationalism harm the targets of their rhetoric, obviously, but their real intention is to hoodwink their own followers. By inflaming nationalist fervour, self-serving leaders can more easily win power and, once in office, they can distract public attention from their abuses by calling out the supposed enemies who would otherwise keep them in check."},{"type":"IMAGE","url":"https://www.economist.com/content-assets/images/20230902_DE_EU.jpg","altText":"","mode":"NORMAL","imageType":"UNKNOWN","caption":{"textHtml":""},"credit":null,"source":null,"width":1280,"height":1684},{"type":"PARAGRAPH","text":"Leader: How paranoid nationalism corruptsBriefing: Cynical leaders are whipping up nationalism to win and abuse powerBanyan: Why South-East Asian democracy is declining","textHtml":"\u003cb\u003eLeader:\u003c/b\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/08/31/how-paranoid-nationalism-corrupts\"\u003eHow paranoid nationalism corrupts\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cb\u003eBriefing: \u003c/b\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/08/31/why-paranoid-nationalism-fosters-corruption\"\u003eCynical leaders are whipping up nationalism to win and abuse power\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cb\u003eBanyan: \u003c/b\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/08/31/south-east-asian-democracy-is-declining\"\u003eWhy South-East Asian democracy is declining\u003c/a\u003e"},{"type":"DIVIDER"},{"type":"PARAGRAPH","text":"For subscribers only: to see how we design each week’s cover, sign up to our weekly Cover Story newsletter.","textHtml":"\u003ci\u003eFor subscribers only: to see how we design each week’s cover, sign up to our weekly \u003ca href=\"https://www.economist.com/newsletters/cover-story\"\u003eCover Story newsletter\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/i\u003e"}],"footer":[],"section":{"name":"The world this week","url":"https://www.economist.com/the-world-this-week/"},"seo":{"title":null,"description":null}},"statusCode":200,"paywallCheck":{"shouldDropPaywall":false},"featureFlags":["SF_SIGNPOSTING","SOURCEPOINT","ONBOARDING_NOTIFICATION","ONBOARDING_GROUP_NOTIFICATION","OPTIMIZELY_SELF_HOSTING","LAPSED_USER_NOTIFICATION","CP2","IN_THIS_REPORT","REGISTRANT_ONBOARDING","SITEMAP","APP_PROMO_PAGE","CLOUDFLARE_IMAGE_FORMAT","NEXT_SCRIPT_THIRD_PARTIES","PODCAST_SHOW_PROMO_LINK_WIB","SUMMER_EDITION_1843","CP2_MIXING","CP2_LEAD_IMAGES","CP2_SKELETON","CP2_BODY","CP2_FEATURE_HEADER"],"newsletters":{"newsletters":[{"code":"the_war_room","availableTo":["core"],"ident":"the-war-room","title":"The War Room","frequency":"Weekly","imageUrl":"https://myaccount.economist.com/file-asset-public/the_war_room?oid=00D3z000002JvyiEAC","tagline":"Subscriber only","slug":"the-war-room","hasPreview":true,"isNew":false,"description":"The best of \u003cem\u003eThe Economist\u003c/em\u003e’s defence coverage, in one place","promo":{"title":"","description":"","tagline":"Subscriber only"},"keywords":[],"priority":-1,"isKeywordFallback":false,"onboardingPreSelect":false,"live":true},{"code":"plot_twist","availableTo":["core"],"ident":"plot-twist","title":"Plot Twist","frequency":"Weekly","imageUrl":"https://myaccount.economist.com/file-asset-public/Plot_Twist?oid=00D3z000002JvyiEAC","tagline":"Subscriber only","slug":"plot-twist","hasPreview":true,"isNew":false,"description":"A weekly conversation about culture.
