to conduct diplomacy. On August 27th Eli Cohen, the Israeli foreign minister, announced that days earlier in Rome he had met his Libyan counterpart, Najla al-Mangoush. The meeting was meant to be secret. His disclosure sparked protests across Libya, which has no overt ties with Israel.\nThe Libyan foreign ministry downplayed it as a chance encounter. Israeli officials countered that it was a well-planned meeting which lasted two hours. Ms Mangoush was sacked and then fled the country. Opposition MPs in Israel castigated Mr Cohen for his “amateurish” decision to reveal the meeting. American officials are furious too, saying his disclosure damaged their efforts to prod Arab states to recognise Israel.\nSince 2020, when four Arab states signed the Abraham accords, America has made clear that Arab-Israeli normalisation is the main focus of its Middle East policy.\nThe tête-à-tête between the foreign ministers in Rome followed a January meeting between Abdul Hamid Dbeibeh, Libya’s prime minister, and William Burns, America’s CIA director, where they discussed the topic. Mr Dbeibeh has tried to distance himself from the Rome meeting, but it is hard to imagine Ms Mangoush met Mr Cohen without her boss’s approval. If you are an unelected Arab leader hungry for American support, the quickest way to win it is to talk about relations with Israel.\nMr Dbeibeh’s government was not alone in doing so. Saddam Haftar, a son of Khalifa Haftar, a powerful warlord in eastern Libya, held secret meetings with Israeli officials in 2021. He proposed normalising ties in exchange for weapons and diplomatic support. Israel has also had contacts in the past with Saif al-Islam Qaddafi, a son of the dictator deposed in 2011, who is eyeing a run for president in Libya’s long-delayed elections.\nThe controversial decisions by the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain to sign the Abraham accords unlocked billions of dollars in bilateral investment, brought a flood of Israeli tourists to the Gulf, and boosted security ties with the Middle East’s strongest power.\nWith Libya the benefits would be far less solid. It is unlikely that Israeli firms would invest in a chronically unstable state—let alone that Israeli tourists would visit it. Selling arms to Libya would be tricky: the country is under a UN arms embargo. Talks with Israel are less about the national interest than about the narrow interests of power-hungry politicians.\nThere is an obvious corollary in Sudan, which has struggled through a fraught transition since the coup in 2019 against Omar al-Bashir, its dictator. The army leadership has moved ahead with recognition of Israel, which Sudan agreed to after America promised to remove it from a list of states that sponsor terrorism, even as it has torn up a plan for moving Sudan to civilian rule and shot hundreds of protesters. In April the Rapid Support Forces, a vicious paramilitary group, attacked the army in their own bid for power. So Israel’s newest relationship in the Arab world is with a state mired in civil war, where an estimated 4m people have fled armed gangs that loot homes and rape women: hardly a monumental diplomatic achievement.\nWith its bewildering mix of politicians and militias, Libya barely qualifies as a state. It has an unelected prime minister, two rival legislatures, and until mid-August two central banks. Even if Mr Dbeibeh agreed to relations with Israel, he could not plausibly sign a deal on behalf of the entire country. Mr Cohen erred in talking about the meeting. But the bigger error lies with an American government that sees value in pushing even the most illegitimate governments to join the accords. ■","description":"Power-hungry politicians see talks with
