In Area A, which includes the main Palestinian towns, the Palestinian Authority was given full civil and security control.

Arab-Israeli normalisation signed in 2020. The first round of deals were between Israel and the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain in September 2020. Sudan normalised relations with Israel the following month and Morocco in December 2020. Negotiations between Israel and Saudi Arabia were disrupted by the war between Israel and Hamas which began in October 2023.\nAl-Shifa hospital\nGaza’s largest hospital. Israel claims that Hamas has its underground headquarters below the building, which Hamas denies. Attacking health-care facilities can be illegal under international law.\nRead all of our coverage of the war between Israel and Hamas\n\nArab Revolt in Palestine\nIn 1936 unrest broke out in the British mandate of Palestine amid frustration at rising Jewish immigration in the wake of Britain’s Balfour Declaration. By the summer of 1939 the uprising had been suppressed—but Britain later faced Jewish revolts and after the second world war handed the problem to the United Nations, which voted to partition the land.\n\n\n\nAreas A, B and C\nA messy patchwork of control in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, agreed in 1995 as part of the Oslo II accord. In Area A, which includes the main Palestinian towns, the Palestinian Authority was given full civil and security control. In Area B it had power over civil affairs and some aspects of law and order, but Israel retained ultimate security control. In Area C, which includes most Jewish settlements, Israel kept full control. See map.\nArmistice (1949)\nPeace deals signed after the first Arab–Israeli war of 1948. Israel and Arab states divided up the land. No Palestinian state was created; Egypt controlled Gaza while Transjordan (later Jordan) formally annexed the West Bank.

It includes Hamas in Gaza and the West Bank, Shia militias in Iraq, Hizbullah in Lebanon, militant groups in Syria and the Houthi militia in Yemen.\nBalfour Declaration \nOn November 2nd 1917 Britain issued the Balfour Declaration, named after ​​Arthur Balfour, the British foreign secretary, stating its support for “the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people”. The document also insists that “nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine”.\n\nBinyamin Netanyahu\nIsrael’s longest-serving prime minister and head of the right-wing Likud party. Since December 2022 has led a coalition which includes far-right nationalist and ultra-religious parties.

It also built a security barrier in the West Bank.\n\nEast Jerusalem\nA sector of Jerusalem annexed by Jordan after the first Arab-Israeli war in 1948, then captured and annexed by Israel during the Six Day War in 1967.

It is home to roughly 2.2m people, many of whom rely on international aid, and has been run by Hamas, a militant group, since 2007. It was placed under siege, bombarded and then invaded by Israel in retaliation for Hamas’s attack in October 2023. Read our short history of Gaza.\nGenocide \nDefined by the UN as acts intended “to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group”.

It describes campaigns fought by Palestinians against the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza. The first intifada, which began in 1987, involved mainly strikes and stone-throwing.

Under the UN partition plan of 1947, Jerusalem was intended to be an international city, part of neither the future Jewish nor Arab states. It was divided by Israel and Jordan in the armistice of 1949. The eastern half was captured by Israel in the Six Day war of 1967, and annexed as part of its “eternal and indivisible capital”. Most countries keep their embassies in Tel Aviv, but the United States relocated its mission to Jerusalem in 2018.\nJerusalem day\nAn Israeli holiday marking Israel’s capture of East Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza in the Six Day War in June 1967.\nKhan Younis\nA city and a refugee camp in southern Gaza in which many of the current leadership of Hamas grew up.\nKibbutz\nAgricultural communities in Israel often run as collective economies.

Launched by Israel in an attempt to destroy Hizbullah, an Iran-backed militant group and political party which had created a “state within a state” in the south of the country.

Around 7m Palestinians live in Israel, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Another 7m are strewn across the Arab world and beyond.

Israel tripled its territory, capturing the West Bank, East Jerusalem, the Gaza Strip, the Golan Heights and the Sinai peninsula. Israel has since moved to build Jewish settlements on some of the land occupied during the war.\nSuez crisis\nIn October 1956 Israel invaded Egypt, capturing the Sinai peninsula and the Gaza Strip. The conflict was planned in collusion with Britain and France in order to allow them to regain control of the Suez Canal which they had run until Egypt’s president, Gamal Abdul Nasser, nationalised it in July 1956. America was outraged and pushed Britain to abort the mission. In December 1956 the Israelis withdrew from Sinai and in March 1957 they withdrew from Gaza.\nSykes-Picot Agreement \nDuring the first world war Sir Mark Sykes, a British diplomat, and François Georges-Picot, a French one, were appointed to secretly divvy up the lands of the Ottoman empire. The Arab provinces were to be split up among European powers.

At the end of the war Israel increased its territory to include land the UN had intended for an Arab state, as well as West Jerusalem. Transjordan held the West Bank and East Jerusalem and Egypt held the Gaza Strip. The war was followed by the mass displacement of Palestinian Arabs, known in Arabic as the Nakba.\nWest Bank \nIsraeli-occupied territory run in part by the Palestinian Authority. Palestinians view it as the core of their would-be state. Right-wing and religious Israelis regard it as their ancestral territory, with many biblical sites, and are pushing for Israel to annex it in part or entirely. Home to increasing numbers of Israeli settlers.\nYom Kippur war \nIn October 1973, on the Jewish holy day of Yom Kippur, Egypt and Syria launched an attack in Sinai and the Golan Heights. The war lasted three weeks and ended with a ceasefire secured by the UN.\nZionism \nA movement founded by Theodor Herzl, an Austro-Hungarian Jew, with the aim of creating a Jewish homeland.
