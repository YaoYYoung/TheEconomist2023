Economist"],"url":"https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/11/22/britains-autumn-statement-got-business-taxes-right","type":"Article","articleBody":"You DO NOT have to be an economic historian to know that politicians like to cut taxes before elections. On November 22nd Jeremy Hunt, Britain’s chancellor of the exchequer, announced tax cuts worth £18bn (0.7% of GDP), 14 months at most before Britain goes to the polls. Mr Hunt said he was able to loosen the purse strings because of his sound economic stewardship. One of his measures was indeed a striking example of sensible policymaking. Unfortunately, the rest of the budget leaves a mess for the next government, which surveys suggest is very likely to be formed by the Labour Party. \nStart with what he got right. Mr Hunt said that he would make permanent “full expensing”—the right of businesses to deduct upfront their capital expenditures from their taxable profits. This nerdy-sounding change was probably the single biggest pro-growth tax reform he could have unveiled that was also politically feasible. Expensing undoes much of the investment-crushing effect of corporate taxes. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), Britain’s fiscal watchdog, estimates that the policy will boost annual business investment by almost 1% of GDP—a welcome fillip in an economy that has been starved of capital expenditure. Estonia and Latvia have permanent full expensing, but among big rich economies Britain will stand out for the friendliness of its tax code.\nWhere did the money come from? Mr Hunt said that a fall in inflation had made possible both permanent expensing and his other headline-grabbing tax cut: a two-percentage-point reduction in the rate of national insurance, a payroll tax. In fact, close to the opposite is true. Most of the “headroom” was created by inflation forecasts rising. Higher inflation fills the Treasury’s coffers because the government has frozen tax allowances in cash terms. Yet the chancellor is not increasing public investment to make up for higher inflation. In effect, he has pencilled in further real-terms cuts in public spending. \nAfter analysing various government-spending pledges, the OBR calculates that some budgets would have to fall in real terms by an average of 4.1% per year after 2026 to make the government’s numbers add up.
