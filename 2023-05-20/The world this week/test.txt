After the chaos of the Trump years, President Joe Biden’s commitment to diplomacy is welcome, but his doctrine is flawed. Its diagnosis of America’s problems is too pessimistic, and some of its prescriptions would make America weaker.\n\nLeader: Joe Biden’s global vision is too timid and pessimistic\nUnited States: The fault lines in America’s China policy\nBriefing: Henry Kissinger explains how to avoid world war three\nFor subscribers only: to see how we design each week’s cover, sign up to our weekly Cover Story
