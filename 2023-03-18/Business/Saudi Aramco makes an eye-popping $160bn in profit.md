The world’s energy supermajors had a bountiful 2022. ExxonMobil, the largest of the private-sector giants, reported a record annual net profit of $56bn, after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine sent oil prices soaring. Mouth-watering—unless you are Saudi Aramco, in which case it’s peanuts. Last year the desert kingdom’s oil giant brought in some $160bn of net income, the most by any company in corporate history.■
