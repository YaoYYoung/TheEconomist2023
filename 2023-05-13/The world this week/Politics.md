A jury in Manhattan found  liable for sexually abusing a woman in the mid-1990s and for defaming her, and awarded her $5m. He called the verdict a “disgrace”. The jury did not agree that Mr Trump’s abuse of E. Jean Carroll constituted rape.

At least eight people died in violence that swept across  after Imran Khan, a former prime minister, was arrested and charged with graft. Senior leaders of his party were also detained.

The Republican Party and other right-of-centre parties won the majority of seats in an election to choose members of an assembly that will draw up  new constitution. The main left-wing coalition won 16, leaving it short of the number needed for a veto. A draft constitution by a previous assembly was rejected in a referendum last year, because it was seen as too left-wing.

The annual Victory Day parade in  to commemorate the country’s triumph against Nazi Germany was somewhat muted, given Vladimir Putin’s setbacks in Ukraine. The parade in Moscow featured just one tank. In his speech the president struck his usual belligerent tone, claiming the West was trying to destroy Russia. Kim Jong Un, North Korea’s dictator, sent “warm wishes” to Russia in its “holy fight to preserve world peace”. 
Russia launched another wave of missiles at , most of them targeting Kyiv, the capital. Ukrainian forces shot almost all of them down.
