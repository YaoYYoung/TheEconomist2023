It manages to be at once difficult, dramatic and fundamentally unimpressive. The sport leans into this contradiction. Each player has a nickname and entry music, aping professional wrestling. “Rapid” Ricky Evans, a player built for comfort rather than speed, emerges to the soundtrack of “Merry Christmas Everyone” by Shakin’ Stevens; he wears a shirt with a large cartoon of himself as Santa.
