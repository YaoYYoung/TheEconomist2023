In Mr López Obrador’s haste to finish various mega-projects—a refinery, a new airport in Mexico City and an interoceanic corridor in the south—he often opens them half-finished. For now the train is only operating on the stretch between Campeche and Cancún, on a limited timetable. The first journey took over nine hours, far longer than by car.

The government reckons that the railway will cost more than triple its original budget of 120bn-150bn pesos, a huge sum that might have been better spent on basic infrastructure the area lacks, such as roads, drinking water and electricity.

They will also operate it. In 2021 he declared the project a national-security matter, reissuing the decree this year after the Supreme Court struck it down. His railroading may pay off.
