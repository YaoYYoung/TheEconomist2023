Dear Max,
Now you ask, I’m not really even sure what a watercooler is. But the basic idea is to find a place where you know colleagues are bound to go regularly and where you can engage in light conversation about whether they saw anything good on TV last night. My advice is to hang around any tap and you should meet colleagues fairly regularly. 

I wouldn’t worry too much. Those stories are mostly made-up and all deliberately boring. No executive ever opens a meeting talking about how they woke up in their own clothes but in a total stranger’s apartment. The goal is only to put people at their ease by making the speaker seem faintly human. Just say exactly what you put in your message above and then make your face go a bit vulnerable. That should do the trick.

This is a truly revolting trend. There are people walking around offices right now saying things like “Focaccia seems to be taken. Is Ciabatta free?”, “I’m in Ulaanbaatar. Where are you?” and “Let’s set up a projector in Nelson Mandela”. You either sound totally idiotic or as if you are suggesting something appalling. Just describe the room you are referring to: the one where Mandy gave that terrible presentation, say, or the one where absolutely nothing works.

I’m afraid you have developed non-impostor syndrome. Impostor syndrome, the much more common condition, is the worry that you are not good enough to take on certain roles. If you own up to this feeling, you will almost certainly be told that you are way better than the people who blithely hold those roles now. If you have non-impostor syndrome, you start to wonder whether you are one of the people they mean and therefore deeply incompetent. The only known cure for non-impostor syndrome is impostor syndrome. 
 
I think I know what’s happened here. Leave this one with me. 

I called the people who made this tool and they have never heard of this kind of behaviour before. We have looked at your photo on LinkedIn and we do all agree that the AI seems to be making exactly the right call. On the downside, we also seem to be closer to the Singularity.

There are only three ways to handle this common problem. One is to start so loudly that everyone immediately gives way. You may come up against a fellow-shouter and then it’s just a battle of nerves: who is going to give way? The second is to raise your hand and wait: you’ll get your turn eventually and be listened to. The third is to get promoted. If you are senior enough, it doesn’t matter how ludicrous a point you are making; everyone gives way. Keep sending me your problems, and enjoy the break! ■
