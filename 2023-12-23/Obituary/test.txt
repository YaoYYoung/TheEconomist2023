Almost every event brought with it a flurry and jingle of Morris men (another passion of his), an accordion player and a fiddler or two, notably at dawn on May Day, when he dressed his hat in withy branches to be Jack-in-the-Green, just when green was springing through the woods.

He wanted to save his patch of countryside, especially the local breeds of cattle, sheep and pigs—for Gloucestershire was lucky, and rare, to have its own local versions of all three. In 1972, at an auction in Arlingham, he and some friends clubbed together to buy the last pure-bred herd of Gloucester cattle, and he co-founded the Gloucester Cattle Society to allow him to register them for formal breeding. They were gorgeous animals with black-mahogany coats, a white stripe along their backs, white tails and undersides and a peaceful nature. Just to stand among them out in the field, scratching their heads, did his heart good. He was a slowish sort, like them. The breed dated back to the 13th century, and their milk was the basis of Single and Double Gloucester cheese; their meat, too, was good. But they were too general-purpose for modern butchers. His steady building of the herd, and his promotion of the breed (among the butchers of Newent as well as through the Rare Breeds Survival Trust, which again he co-founded) gradually proved that they were both beautiful and useful.

That was fine if you were a cottage-dweller hacking a slice from the flitch that hung on the wall, but not to the modern taste. He fed his small herd treats, and sloshed their bristly coats with buckets of water.

His first job on his father’s farm—having left school knowing much less about the three Rs than about clubbing rats and rabbits in the harvest stubble—was hoeing crops, and he learned how by working between Cecil, who hoed as if it was nothing, and Joe, who pushed after, just as an untrained colt would learn to work between two experienced horses. Teams of men ploughed, harvested, threshed, drove carts, with their families lending a hand. But modern fields were empty. He noticed the same vacancy in the streets of Newent, where children once played and the elderly, when the weather was good enough, set their chairs outside their open doors and chatted with passers-by. There was plenty good about the 21st century, especially the media coverage he got for his cause; he was no hermit.

He wanted to save his patch of countryside, especially the local breeds of cattle, sheep and pigs—for Gloucestershire was lucky, and rare, to have its own local versions of all three.  In 1972, at an auction in Arlingham, he and some friends clubbed together to buy the last pure-bred herd of Gloucester cattle, and he co-founded the Gloucester Cattle Society to allow him to register them for formal breeding. They were gorgeous animals with black-mahogany coats, a white stripe along their backs, white tails and undersides and a peaceful nature. Just to stand among them out in the field, scratching their heads, did his heart good. He was a slowish sort, like them. The breed dated back to the 13th century, and their milk was the basis of Single and Double Gloucester cheese; their meat, too, was good. But they were too general-purpose for modern butchers. His steady building of the herd, and his promotion of the breed (among the butchers of Newent as well as through the Rare Breeds Survival Trust, which again he co-founded) gradually proved that they were both beautiful and useful.","textHtml":"He didn’t always mean to be comfortable, though.
