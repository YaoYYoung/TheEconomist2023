Economist"],"url":"https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2023/05/31/cheap-single-dose-hpv-vaccines-could-save-millions-of-lives","type":"Article","articleBody":"Alongside ailments resulting from hepatitis B, cervical cancer has a strong claim to be the world’s deadliest vaccine-preventable disease. Most illnesses for which effective vaccines for children are widely available no longer threaten public health. But in 2020, 14 years after the advent of a jab that prevents almost all cases, cervical cancer still killed 342,000 women. If take-up of the vaccine rose—a goal about which there are new grounds for hope—this cancer could be nearly eliminated.\nFully 95% of cervical-cancer cases are caused by human papillomavirus (hpv), a group of sexually transmitted viruses. So common is hpv that nearly every sexually active person contracts a strain. Most never know, because the body flushes it out within two years. In some cases, however, the virus lingers, forming lesions on women’s cervixes that can become cancerous.\nThis deadly condition is the second most common cancer among women aged 15-44. In rich countries, five-year survival rates are around 70%. In the poorest ones, which account for 90% of deaths from cervical cancer, less than one in five women with the disease are thought to survive.\nThe hpv jab, if given before people become sexually active, fully protects against hpv. But take-up has been slow. In the rich world, the share of people vaccinated by age 15 ranges from zero in Japan, which only resumed recommending the jab in 2022, to 81% in Britain. Many poorer countries have never begun vaccination drives. Worldwide, just 12% of eligible girls got the jab in 2021, down from 14% in 2019.\n\n\n\nThe nature of hpv can hinder vaccination efforts. Many countries lack systems to distribute vaccines at ages nine to 15, and some parents are squeamish about vaccinating young girls against a sexually transmitted virus. Moreover, the jab’s benefits are not felt until the age when cervical cancer is diagnosed, typically 15-35 years later.\nHowever, two other roadblocks are now being cleared. In December the World Health Organisation (who) said that a single dose of the hpv jab provided full protection. This will vastly expedite vaccination efforts. In addition, firms in both China and India are now producing their countries’ first domestic hpv jabs. The Serum Institute of India plans to make 200m doses in two years at prices well below the current market rate. Its output should supply India’s first national vaccination effort.\n\n\n\nThe who has set a goal for the hpv vaccination rate to reach 90% by 2030, entailing a sustained increase of nine percentage points per year. Based on a statistical model built by scholars at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, we estimate that among girls eligible for vaccination by 2030, this path would reduce the number who wind up dying of cervical cancer by 2.65m, when compared with the status quo. Maintaining the 90% rate beyond 2030 would prevent another 650,000 deaths among girls vaccinated in each subsequent year, before accounting for population growth. With cheap, single-dose vaccines on the horizon, such numbers may no longer be the stuff of fantasy.■\nChart sources: London School of Hygiene \u0026 Tropical Medicine; WHO; UNICEF; HPV Information Centre; The Economist","description":"A turning-point looms in the campaign to eliminate the disease","ogDescription":"A turning-point looms in the campaign to eliminate the disease","imageUrl":"https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20230603_WOT969.png","imageHeight":720,"imageWidth":1280,"datePublished":"2023-05-31T19:07:02Z","dateModified":"2023-06-02T12:34:33Z","dateCreated":"2023-05-31T11:15:24Z","isPrintArticle":true,"printEdition":"2023-06-03T00:00:00Z","copyrightYear":2023,"dateline":"","inLanguage":"en","interactive":true,"scripts":["https://infographics.economist.com1","https://infographics.economist.com1","https://infographics.economist.com1"],"css":[]},"sectionArticles":[{"id":"/content/vhdmt5791vv7c33ni94jro9svsld7efs","publication":[{"id":"/content/1j4g1b7i11b39p756vr9tesmuu8a4luh","context":{"position":2000.76,"__typename":"Content"},"__typename":"Content"},{"id":"/content/ri72k91dd5nm6v26u7erp2v8e8371nmg","context":{"position":2000.76,"__typename":"Content"},"__typename":"Content"},{"id":"/content/lmp76enjkjv7btaqj28qtaq5smf04e2t","context":{"position":2000.76,"__typename":"Content"},"__typename":"Content"},{"id":"/content/3dod75kl9ea8rcf0815hjfo69k5fr36m","context":{"position":2000.76,"__typename":"Content"},"__typename":"Content"},{"id":"/content/pj7t4ogpssf9paimdqaldah7bjas5gm5","context":{"position":2000.76,"__typename":"Content"},"__typename":"Content"},{"id":"/content/jk6ku2qvv3gqqkghg3bns4r2ev33liuh","context":{"position":2000.76,"__typename":"Content"},"__typename":"Content"},{"id":"/content/bnmouj7040l9tfhd0ccp5v257o7ugoff","context":{"position":2000.76,"__typename":"Content"},"__typename":"Content"},{"id":"/content/qv0bbjfohj4h6ot430d70alhlnvjf3lr","context":{"position":2000.76,"__typename":"Content"},"__typename":"Content"}],"headline":"Cheap vaccines could prevent millions of deaths from cervical cancer","url":{"canonical":"https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2023/05/31/cheap-single-dose-hpv-vaccines-could-save-millions-of-lives","__typename":"URL"},"__typename":"Content"}]},"cp2Content":{"id":"8efbd9fb-04d8-4f7d-8dcc-bd849566d4b7","tegId":"vhdmt5791vv7c33ni94jro9svsld7efs","url":"/graphic-detail/2023/05/31/cheap-vaccines-could-prevent-millions-of-deaths-from-cervical-cancer","headline":"Cheap vaccines could prevent millions of deaths from cervical cancer","flyTitle":"Low-hanging fruit","rubric":"A turning-point looms in the campaign to eliminate the disease","byline":null,"dateline":null,"layout":{"headerStyle":"STANDARD"},"brand":"ECONOMIST","dateModified":"2023-06-02T12:35:14.385Z","dateCreated":"2023-05-31T19:10:53.824Z","datePublished":"2023-06-02T12:34:33.000Z","dateFirstPublished":"2023-05-31T19:07:02.000Z","dateRevised":"2023-05-31T19:07:02.000Z","leadComponent":null,"body":[{"type":"PARAGRAPH","text":"Alongside ailments resulting from hepatitis B, cervical cancer has a strong claim to be the world’s deadliest vaccine-preventable disease.

Maintaining the 90% rate beyond 2030 would prevent another 650,000 deaths among girls vaccinated in each subsequent year, before accounting for population growth. With cheap, single-dose vaccines on the horizon, such numbers may no longer be the stuff of fantasy.■","textHtml":"The \u003csmall\u003ewho\u003c/small\u003e has set a goal for the \u003csmall\u003ehpv\u003c/small\u003e vaccination rate to reach 90% by 2030, entailing a sustained increase of nine percentage points per year. Based on a statistical model built by scholars at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, we estimate that among girls eligible for vaccination by 2030, this path would reduce the number who wind up dying of cervical cancer by 2.65m, when compared with the status quo.
