This week’s jump in the share price was triggered by Nvidia forecasting a huge increase in quarterly sales and assuring markets that it could increase supplies of its H100 chips, used in large-language AI models. Nvidia is getting orders from a wide range of companies, from cloud-computing providers to online-shopping websites, in their rush to adopt generative AI. 
Profits from doom
A group of heavyweights who work in AI, including the bosses of Google’s DeepMind and OpenAI, signed a statement warning that “mitigating the  from AI should be a global priority”, on the same scale as pandemics and nuclear war. Many scientists think that fears of AI wiping out humanity are overblown, and point to less apocalyptic problems with the technology, such as its generation of fake imagery.

America’s Supreme Court declined to hear a case claiming that Reddit, an online platform, is responsible for child-pornography images hosted on the site.

Chinese media heralded the inaugural commercial flight of the C919, a  built by Comac, a state-owned planemaker. The C919 is touted by the Chinese government as a potential rival to Airbus and Boeing in China’s aviation market, stressing the country’s technological independence in the face of some American sanctions.

Proposals by  at the annual shareholders’ meetings at Chevron and ExxonMobil received less support than in previous years.

Total’s chief executive, Patrick Pouyanné, defended the climate-transition plan of the French company, describing the naysayers as “grumps”.

In a final humiliation for the Swiss bank a court has ordered it to pay $926m to Bidzina Ivanishvili, a former prime minister of Georgia, in a fraud case. The firm is appealing against the judgment. 
ChatGPT in the dock
Amid all the hoopla about   it emerged that ChatGPT had invented more than half a dozen legal precedents when a lawyer used it for research in a lawsuit against an airline. The lawyer presented the brief to the court when arguing the case. When the judge found out he had used ChatGPT, the lawyer pleaded for mercy: his source “has revealed itself to be unreliable”, he said.
