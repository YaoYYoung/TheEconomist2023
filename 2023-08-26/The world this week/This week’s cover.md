Our cover this week looks at China’s economic woes. The economy grew at an annualised rate of just 3.2% in the second quarter, a disappointment that looks even worse given that, by one prominent estimate, America’s may be growing at almost 6%. With its government making bad decisions and centralising power, China is entering a period of disappointment after four decades of fast growth. It is testing whether more autocracy eventually damages the economy. The evidence is mounting that it does.
