We appreciate the invitation to make the case for what we believe can and should be done. Two of us are lawyers.

We know that, as the Ukraine war wears on, the outcome may be determined by the balance of hope or despair as well as on the battlefield. The Ukrainian economy is in the intensive-care unit.

As international law confronts its most severe test since the founding of the United Nations, states can wring their hands, baffled, while Ukraine burns. Or they can strengthen international law.\nThe international law of state countermeasures differs from law or EU directives which govern “sanctions”. Countermeasures have long been recognised as extra-judicial state measures of self-help.

The Economist called for “patient, relentless work to expand the legal case against Russia”. But a ruling by the International Court of Justice (ICJ), handed down in March 2022, has already demanded that Russia end its aggression, and Russia has ignored this obligation for 16 months. In November 2022 the UN General Assembly established Russia’s duty to provide reparations under the very procedure—“a stand-in for the Security Council”—that The Economist recommended.

WEEK The Economist cautioned about how to use Russian assets to help Ukraine. We appreciate the invitation to make the case for what we believe can and should be done. Two of us are lawyers. Each of us has worked on problems of international law and knows the arguments in this case. We know that, as the Ukraine war wears on, the outcome may be determined by the balance of hope or despair as well as on the battlefield. The Ukrainian economy is in the intensive-care unit. But we face a unique circumstance. As Russia launched the largest act of international aggression since the second world war, it left enormous sums, at least $300bn-worth of dollars, euros, sterling and yen, in the law-abiding states that oppose this aggression.\nPublic international law has always combined “black letter” law with customs established as state practice adapts to new challenges. As international law confronts its most severe test since the founding of the United Nations, states can wring their hands, baffled, while Ukraine burns. Or they can strengthen international law.\nThe international law of state countermeasures differs from law or EU directives which govern “sanctions”. Countermeasures have long been recognised as extra-judicial state measures of self-help. As the UN’s International Law Commission explained back in 2001, “traditionally the term ‘reprisals’ was used to cover otherwise unlawful action, including forcible action, taken by way of self-help in response to a breach.” Now international lawyers use the term “countermeasures” for non-violent reprisals, with the law limiting collective countermeasures to the most serious cases. \nWe have proposed that, as one such countermeasure, relevant states should transfer frozen Russian assets into escrow to give Ukraine hope that it can rebuild, perhaps also help others injured by Russia’s aggression, and assist in a future settlement. The countermeasure would induce Russia to perform its legal duty to compensate, voluntarily or involuntarily, the victims of its aggression. Though some worry that the move might make some countries more reluctant to hold dollars or euros, it poses no added risk to the stability of reserve currencies.\nThe Economist worried that state assets are ordinarily protected from transfer or seizure under a doctrine of sovereign immunity. But this doctrine applies to judgments by foreign courts. State assets, in contrast to private assets, are protected from other sovereigns only by customary obligations of reciprocal regard (or in bilateral investment treaties). Court action is unnecessary or quite limited in the case of an international act of state. State assets have been seized or transferred before. In 1992, in the lesser case of Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait, America and European countries placed Iraqi state assets into escrow to compensate Iraq’s victims (including mainly claims from Kuwait but also from 42 other states) without Iraq’s voluntary consent.\nOrdinarily Russia could claim repayment for lost assets. In this case Russia’s own serious breach of the inviolable norms of international law permits a legal suspension of that obligation. The Economist called for “patient, relentless work to expand the legal case against Russia”. But a ruling by the International Court of Justice (ICJ), handed down in March 2022, has already demanded that Russia end its aggression, and Russia has ignored this obligation for 16 months. In November 2022 the UN General Assembly established Russia’s duty to provide reparations under the very procedure—“a stand-in for the Security Council”—that The Economist recommended. Russia has ignored that notice and duty for nine months.\nCalls for years of litigation in the ICJ—which even then could end fruitlessly, just as Georgia’s case against Russia fizzled for jurisdictional reasons more than ten years ago—seem, as former American secretary of state George Marshall put it, like allowing the patient to die while the doctors deliberate. The Russian assets sit idle while damages grow, rewarding the aggressor. There is indeed much more work to do in preparing the way for the transfer of funds, and more work to design international mechanisms for timely reconstruction assistance and sifting claims. But the legal prerequisites for the enabling countermeasure have been met.\nWhy does The Economist seem to offer such conflicted advice? Its article candidly revealed the core of the opposing position: Russia’s assets, it said, can only be used if Russia consents.\nWhy? Because, we are told, the opponents fear that such countermeasures might be abused by powerful states. Any law enforcement can be abused. But reflect on the paradox. In this argument to restrain the powerful, it is Russia, the powerful aggressor, whose rights take precedence over the rights of those it has injured. And this will reinforce the rule of law?\nThe solicitude for Russia’s rights is particularly ironic. We advocate targeting only Russian state assets. Anything else, such as moves against oligarchs, would indeed require due process to establish an association between that person and the target state.\nRussia is not so considerate. In April it announced a presidential decree using the doctrine of state countermeasures to declare that it can seize private companies if they are domiciled in countries deemed “unfriendly”. It then seized German and Finnish companies and has since grabbed the Russian operations of Danone, a French food company, and Carlsberg, a Danish brewer, turning them over to Vladimir Putin’s cronies. To this patently unlawful use of state countermeasures, Western governments have offered no coherent reply.\nSome of those who disagree with us fall back to a position that a countermeasure must be reversible. They presume Russia might have to be paid back. But the well-established codification of this principle, adopted more than 20 years ago by the UN’s International Law Commission, says that the suspended obligations need only be restored “as far as possible”.\nIn 1949 Robert Jackson, a justice on the United States Supreme Court, warned: “There is a danger that, if the court does not temper its doctrinaire logic with a little practical wisdom, it will convert the constitutional Bill of Rights into a suicide pact.”\nAt this moment in history, those who want to defend the rule of law should not take positions that would cut out its heart. ■\nLawrence Summers is President Emeritus and Charles W.
