Economist"],"url":"https://www.economist.com/letters/2023/06/29/letters-to-the-editor","type":"Article","articleBody":"Letters are welcome via e-mail to letters@economist.com\nBack to economic basics\nFaced with ruinous inflation, Turkey’s people should welcome the appointment of Hafize Gaye Erkan as governor of the central bank and Mehmet Simsek as finance minister (“Braking at the cliff’s edge”, June 10th). The appointments signal a return to economic orthodoxy. However, unless Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the country’s re-elected president, has undergone a change of heart, it’s going to be an uphill struggle. \nIn 2018 Mr Erdogan appointed his son-in-law, Berat Albayrak, as finance minister in the belief that he could command market forces. Two years later Mr Albayrak resigned for health reasons after splurging $128bn in foreign-exchange reserves to defend the lira. Mr Erdogan has dogmatically insisted that interest rates are “the mother and father of all evil” and has fired three central-bank governors for not reducing them. Two years ago the president made clear at a meeting with the Turkish Industry and Business Association that as a Muslim he would continue to lower interest rates in accordance with Islamic teaching. \nNow Ms Erkan has cautiously increased the benchmark interest rate from 8.5% to 15%, although the market expected 20%. And the lira has crashed. The question is who will blink first when Islamic teaching comes into conflict with economic orthodoxy.\nRobert Ellis\nInternational adviser \nResearch Institute for European and American Studies\nAthens\n\nIt’s all about the cloud\nYour leader on the Microsoft-Activision deal accepted without question the market definition that Microsoft has been promoting to the competition-policy authorities (“Merger crush saga”, June 24th). On \nthis logic, the deal is about two kinds of gaming platforms (console and cloud) that add up to one market in which Microsoft is hardly a dominant player. What’s more, the company has promised to keep console platforms competitive by guaranteeing to other console providers ten-year access to key titles, while the potential for expanding the new and fast-growing platform of cloud gaming promises a net benefit to consumers. All good, so far as it goes. \nBut cloud gaming is not so much about gaming as it is about the cloud, and here the competition policy issues are more profound. The data engineering, graphics, real-time compute, language and image synthesis, and related functions that power today’s games are precisely the technologies that will power tomorrow’s AI-supercharged enterprise cloud applications. And in that much larger and more important market, Microsoft’s old habits of bundling, licensing and leveraging market power have continued largely unabated. \nThe Federal Trade Commission should look at this as a question about the future of the cloud, not simply gaming. It should stop an acquisition that would further advance Microsoft’s subversive efforts to win the future of cloud by creating a battle among walled gardens in enterprise cloud computing—as it has already tried to do with OpenAI.\nSteven Weber \nProfessor of the Graduate School, School of Information \nUniversity of California, Berkeley\n\nBreaking down the silos\nJargon can boost efficiency (Bartleby, June 17th). I can say to a good software engineer that “this needs a mutex” and he knows what I mean. I can quickly judge people’s competency in my field by how much widespread jargon they know. \nOn the other hand jargon is also explicitly a way to keep insiders (who know the jargon) separate and superior to ignorant outsiders or new employees (who don’t know the jargon). It adds a barrier to entry. Corporate management slavishly adapts less efficient opaque phrases as a way to signal false competency. This is a mutation of the insider/outsider use, elevating managers above their customers and employees and bonding with their fellow managers. Like roosters that crow all day long.\nRon Dippold\nSan Diego\nThe origin of the term “fourth leader” used by journalists at The Economist to describe lighthearted opinion articles originates from the Times, where the fourth editorial used to be of a more jovial nature than the three previous, heavyweight ones. \nCedric Reavley\nBurford, Oxfordshire\n\nHonest government\nI enjoyed reading about Botswana’s success story (“Carats and sticks”, June 10th). In 1978 I led a team to rescue a brewery that was in a financial mess. One of the great advantages of operating in Botswana was that the president, Seretse Khama, enforced strict measures against corruption. Ministers and government officials all operated for the benefit of the country. There were no parades of large expensive Mercedes to be seen. In fact, the official ministerial cars were General Motors Commodores. Ministers were quite often seen running about in their own pick-up trucks.\nWhen we sent a couple of cases of beer to the ministry of finance as a Christmas present they were returned. We were politely told that this sort of gift was against the government’s regulations.\nGuy Hallowes\nSydney\n\nWisdom comes with age\nI disagree that innovation, as measured by patent filings, has any correlation with age (“The old and the zestless”, June 3rd). Your article cites research which found that patenting rates peak in a researcher’s late 30s and early 40s. However, this does not necessarily mean that innovation peaks at this age. It is possible that older researchers are simply less likely to be the inventors on patents, because they are more focused on mentoring and other leadership activities. \nThere is a growing body of evidence suggesting that innovation can continue well into old age. For example, a study by the Kauffman Foundation in 2019 found that the rate of new entrepreneurs was highest among Americans aged 45–64 and lowest among those aged 20–34. This suggests that older people have the skills, experience and knowledge necessary to be successful innovators.\nInnovation is not just about coming up with new inventions. It is also about bringing those inventions to market and meeting an unmet customer need. Older people often have the networks and resources necessary to do this. They may also have a better understanding of the needs of customers and the market.\nEric Heinz\nPresident\nHeinz Ventures\nMemphis\n\nOxford’s Harry Potter oak\nBagehot cited the assertion of Theresa May, a former British prime minister, that “there is no magic money tree” (June 3rd). In fact there is one. New College, Oxford, has in its cloister a splendid old tree. It featured in the Harry Potter films. The college’s fee for filming the tree, plus incremental entrance fees from fans who now come to admire it, are sizeable. That money, produced by a tree via magic, suffices to fund a couple of academic positions. \nCaroline Fiennes\nDirector\nGiving Evidence\nLondon","description":"A selection of correspondence","ogDescription":"A selection of correspondence","imageUrl":"https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20230610_EUP508.jpg","imageHeight":720,"imageWidth":1280,"datePublished":"2023-06-29T14:38:41Z","dateModified":"2023-06-29T16:56:54Z","dateCreated":"2023-06-29T11:48:15Z","isPrintArticle":true,"printEdition":"2023-07-01T00:00:00Z","copyrightYear":2023,"dateline":"","inLanguage":"en","interactive":false,"scripts":[],"css":[]},"sectionArticles":[{"id":"/content/813mbepa87dedsn9lvlmkrb4ovho6nbr","publication":[{"id":"/content/a9kh3bod4dp4jjcjndtujs2fl4h9qgsg","context":{"position":300.1,"__typename":"Content"},"__typename":"Content"},{"id":"/content/skhhsufqnbbvl7bourvsq48vcrp2cpen","context":{"position":300.1,"__typename":"Content"},"__typename":"Content"},{"id":"/content/es4jit4fedm6bfhutuir3581a426d3rg","context":{"position":300.1,"__typename":"Content"},"__typename":"Content"},{"id":"/content/aegghod6avs41riqpl2o8ojv4c18jr65","context":{"position":300.1,"__typename":"Content"},"__typename":"Content"},{"id":"/content/ea8nbbps3n12fnjeo8ins4gh0h1ritn2","context":{"position":300.1,"__typename":"Content"},"__typename":"Content"},{"id":"/content/kvm4gm16sdd0se7aj6nfossdhvq4ptgs","context":{"position":300.1,"__typename":"Content"},"__typename":"Content"},{"id":"/content/j85i79foapeo3ohgv8n4mqv7agrgc9mh","context":{"position":300.1,"__typename":"Content"},"__typename":"Content"},{"id":"/content/3j9886o51s2pa0581mkqco17v43ci51d","context":{"position":300.1,"__typename":"Content"},"__typename":"Content"}],"headline":"Letters to the editor","url":{"canonical":"https://www.economist.com/letters/2023/06/29/letters-to-the-editor","__typename":"URL"},"__typename":"Content"}]},"cp2Content":{"id":"ee4d96ae-6081-4e3a-89a0-77394e722ac6","tegId":"813mbepa87dedsn9lvlmkrb4ovho6nbr","url":"/letters/2023/06/29/letters-to-the-editor","headline":"Letters to the editor ","flyTitle":"On Turkey’s economy, Microsoft, jargon, Botswana, older workers, Harry Potter","rubric":"A selection of correspondence ","byline":null,"dateline":null,"layout":{"headerStyle":"STANDARD"},"brand":"ECONOMIST","dateModified":"2023-06-29T16:58:04.848Z","dateCreated":"2023-06-29T14:39:43.408Z","datePublished":"2023-06-29T16:56:54.000Z","dateFirstPublished":"2023-06-29T14:38:41.000Z","dateRevised":"2023-06-29T14:38:41.000Z","leadComponent":{"type":"IMAGE","url":"https://www.economist.com/content-assets/images/20230610_EUP508.jpg","altText":"Turkey's Finance Minister Mehmet Simsek","credit":"Reuters","source":"Reuters","caption":{"textHtml":""},"width":1280,"height":720},"body":[{"type":"PARAGRAPH","text":"Letters are welcome via e-mail to letters@economist.com","textHtml":"\u003cb\u003eLetters are welcome via e-mail to \u003ca href=\"mailto:letters@economist.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eletters@economist.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/b\u003e"},{"type":"CROSSHEAD","text":"Back to economic basics"},{"type":"PARAGRAPH","text":"Faced with ruinous inflation, Turkey’s people should welcome the appointment of Hafize Gaye Erkan as governor of the central bank and Mehmet Simsek as finance minister (“Braking at the cliff’s edge”, June 10th).
