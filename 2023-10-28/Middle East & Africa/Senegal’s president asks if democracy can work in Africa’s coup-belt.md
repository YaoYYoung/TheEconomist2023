Macky Sall, the president of Senegal since 2012, has had a closer view than anyone of the plague of coups in Africa since 2020 and the efforts to reverse them. Two of the first putsches were in Mali, Senegal’s biggest trading partner. Then came one in another neighbour, Guinea. A failed attempt in next-door Guinea-Bissau followed (see map). Mr Sall was chair of the African Union when putschists struck in Burkina Faso for the second time within 2022. And he has played a leading role in the response of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the regional bloc, to every coup, including one in Niger in July. It is worrying, then, that when asked what can be done to deter coups or return countries to democracy he is despondent. “It is difficult, I don’t know,” he says. “Sometimes we get lost.”

The regional bloc once had a passable record of deterring and reversing coups. Led by Mr Sall’s Senegal, it sent troops to The Gambia in 2017 to force that country’s dictator to step down after he lost an election. Yet now, says Mr Sall, “the effectiveness of the organisation, truly, has been found wanting.” The bloc “lacks the capacity to deal with the problems that arise in the region”, he laments. “It is really losing its leadership role.” ECOWAS had threatened to use force in Niger to reinstate the ousted president, Mohamed Bazoum, but the threat proved hollow. “There are several reasons for why...when we said we will intervene, we did not intervene,” he says, concluding “We could not.” He partly blames the influence of countries including America, which has drone bases in Niger and which pressed for peaceful resolution. (Its diplomacy has borne little fruit. Mr Bazoum is still held hostage.) 
Yet the problems go deeper than ECOWAS. “Is democracy as we want to do it really suitable?” he asks in relation to the Sahel. Real power in this region is often not wielded by elected officials, and a focus on polls has not led to stability. In Mali, after an insurgency and a coup in 2012, Mr Sall and the bloc pushed for rapid elections. After a popular revolution in Burkina Faso in 2014 followed by a short-lived coup in 2015, they did the same. Yet the winners of these elections were both eventually overthrown by coups in 2020 and 2022. In Chad, the last Western ally in the Sahel, Mahamat Déby took power unconstitutionally after his father, the president, was killed on the battlefield in 2021. The country is meant to vote next year, but Mr Sall frets that in focusing on this “we risk missing the point.”
One big reason for coups in the Sahel has been the relentless rise of jihadists linked to al-Qaeda and Islamic State. In the first nine months of this year more than 10,000 people died in conflict in Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger. Jihadists are already spreading into Benin and Togo. Alarmed, Mr Sall wants to see the UN play a bigger role. If the problem of terrorism isn’t dealt with, “all of west Africa, all of Africa in general, is going to pay a high price,” he says. 
Senegal itself, usually a bastion of stability, will be a crucial test case of democracy’s resilience when it holds presidential elections in February. Mr Sall warns of a “syndrome of chaos that is threatening our country”. Yet this stems from a damaging political fight between Mr Sall and an opposition leader, Ousmane Sonko, over the rules of the game—and who gets to play it. 
The fight centres around the question of whether Senegal’s government is trying to tilt the election by using the courts to keep Mr Sonko off the ballot. It began more than two years ago when the authorities laid a rape charge against Mr Sonko, a populist firebrand who rails against corruption. Mr Sonko’s supporters claimed that this was a government plot, noting how two of Mr Sall’s main rivals in the presidential election of 2019 were barred from running because of fraud and corruption convictions. The government rejects this.
In June Mr Sonko was acquitted of rape but convicted on a charge of “corruption of youth”, which is defined as immoral behaviour with someone under the age of 21. The conviction seems likely to render him ineligible to run, though the final determination is yet to be made by the constitutional council. 
Trial run
The charge and conviction sparked large protests, some of them violent, in support of Mr Sonko. The demonstrations were also fuelled by hints from Mr Sall that he might try to run for a third presidential term, even though Senegal’s constitution has a two-term limit. It was only in July that Mr Sall definitively said he would not seek office again, after more than two years of protests and at least 37 deaths, according to Amnesty International, a rights group.
Mr Sall’s announcement led to a lull in the violence, though it lasted less than a month until Mr Sonko was once more arrested, this time on charges of plotting an insurrection, criminal conspiracy and other offences. The government also dissolved his political party, Pastef, and arrested many of its leaders, including several mayors. As protests flared, the government cut mobile-internet access for almost a week. Mr Sonko is now on hunger strike and was recently moved to hospital. 
The president claims that Mr Sonko’s party wants anarchy. His sweeping logic for banning it is that the actions and words of Mr Sonko and his party, according to Mr Sall, are at odds with the laws of the republic and its constitution. “They [Pastef] call every day…to go burn the houses of ministers, to go kill people,” claims Mr Sall. Yet Mr Sonko says that it is the government that bends or ignores the law. 
Ousmane Diallo of Amnesty in Senegal says that the government “does not always respect the rule of law”. Earlier this year the police surrounded Mr Sonko’s house in Dakar, the capital, and refused to let him leave. The government also tends to blame Pastef for any call to violence on social media, even from those outside the party. Pastef’s leaders have, indeed, been calling for protests and “resistance”. This is an ambiguous word, Mr Diallo says, but it is not the same as calling for violence. Yet it is also true that many protests have turned violent and that the party’s rhetoric has grown more dangerous, particularly its call for the army “to join the side of the people”. Mr Sonko himself has told his followers: “If you force open the homes [of those in power] you will find billions there.” 
 Even as they chip away at Senegal’s democratic institutions, each side plays down its own excesses. “Senegal has no political prisoners,” claims Mr Sall. Yet nearly 500 people were arrested during the various protests, according to the judicial authorities. Many still languish in jail. “Some of them are definitely political prisoners,” says Mr Diallo. “You have a core leadership of Pastef…who have been arrested and detained for a long time.” Mr Sonko’s party implausibly claims that his extreme comments are taken out of context. 
Many fear more violence before the election, especially if Mr Sonko is definitively barred from running. Even Mr Sall prevaricates when asked if he expects the election to be peaceful. His tough approach to his firebrand rival may help his chosen successor, Amadou Ba, the prime minister, over the line. But it is also polarising and risky, particularly if Mr Sonko is allowed to run. “He will win because they have created a hero by oppressing him,” argues Alioune Tine, a founder of AfrikaJom Centre, a think-tank in Dakar. 
Ruling parties elsewhere in Africa will be watching Senegal closely to see whether they can take a leaf from Mr Sall’s book. The man himself bristles at the suggestion there has been a backsliding of democracy on his watch. “Those who say that [there has been] are supporters of anarchy and chaos,” he retorts. “Senegal has no lessons in democracy to learn from anyone.” ■
