##### How we saw the world

We have one cover this week, looking at the way President Joe Biden could manage the war between Israel and Hamas. Mr Biden has called the present moment an “inflection point”, warning of the need to repulse Hamas’s terror as well as Russia’s aggression against Ukraine. China’s threat to invade Taiwan lurked unspoken in the background. These are formidable obstacles, magnified by America’s domestic politics, which see Republican politicians reverting to isolationism in trade and foreign affairs.
However, America faces these obstacles with formidable military, economic and diplomatic strengths. If Mr Biden succeeds in managing the crisis over Gaza, that would be good for America, good for the Middle East and good for the world.
