to have uprooted at least 3m people. Such estimates are highly imprecise, because so little information is available. Local journalists and activists have been besieged—literally, in some cities—and foreign reporters cannot get close to the fighting. Soldiers have attacked telecoms infrastructure, stopping news from getting out.\nYet some witnesses are beyond the reach of Sudan’s warring factions: satellites flying over the country. Data from their instruments can provide evidence of war crimes, such as the burning of villages. They can also reveal how the current carnage compares with that of the recent past.\nnasa, America’s space agency, runs a satellite-based system called firms, which detects places with unusually high temperatures. It was designed to track forest fires, but logs natural and man-made conflagrations alike. Fire rates in Sudan vary by month, peaking during the dry season from September to March. But many more fires have been recorded in this year’s wet season than in those of the past decade.\nTo isolate fires plausibly tied to fighting, we filtered out hot spots near cement factories, power stations and oil facilities, as well as areas marked as unpopulated in maps by grid3, a non-profit. Since the war began in April, firms has recorded five times as many fires in the remaining areas as the average for these months in 2013-22.\n\n\n\nThe spread of recent fires is as striking as their scale. When the civil war started, it pitted Sudan’s regular army against the Rapid Support Forces, a paramilitary group. At first, much of the destruction was confined to the capital, Khartoum, where belligerents were fighting for control of the government. Yet by the end of April, abnormally numerous fires had erupted across most of southern and western Sudan.\nSatellite images confirm that fires detected in both Darfur, the site of the 21st century’s first genocide, and Khartoum stem from violence. High-resolution photos of areas where firms detected lots of fires show buildings burned to the ground. According to the Sudan Conflict Observatory, a research outfit at Yale University commissioned by America’s State Department to monitor a series of partially observed ceasefires, at least 0.7 square kilometres of el-Geneina in West Darfur had been affected by fire by late June. In nearby Murnei, at least two square kilometres were torched in just two days last month.\nThe increase in fires also aligns with reports trickling out from the country. The Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (acled), a non-profit, finds that the current rate of violent events reported in Sudan is twice as high as the previous maximum since its records began in 1997 (though such data may be more complete in recent years). Just like the fire maps, acled’s log shows fighting across the south, a region previously spared from mass violence—though the rise in fires seen from space greatly exceeds the number of violent events tracked by acled.\n\n\n\nEstimating the death toll is a far harder task. Fire counts reveal nothing about victims, and of the 1,150 violent events logged by acled since April 15th, 388 are listed with “casualties unknown”. When news does emerge, it is likely to be grim. On July 13th the un said it had discovered 87 bodies in a mass grave outside el-Geneina.■\nInspect all our code, data and models on GitHub\nChart sources: NASA; ACLED; GRID3; Google Earth; The Economist","description":"Throughout the south and in the capital, the number of fires detected from space is abnormally high","ogDescription":"Throughout the south and in the capital, the number of fires detected from space is abnormally high","imageUrl":"https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20230722_WOT995.png","imageHeight":718,"imageWidth":1280,"datePublished":"2023-07-20T14:54:57Z","dateModified":"2023-07-20T15:16:48Z","dateCreated":"2023-07-19T17:56:05Z","isPrintArticle":true,"printEdition":"2023-07-22T00:00:00Z","copyrightYear":2023,"dateline":"","inLanguage":"en","interactive":true,"scripts":["https://infographics.economist.com1","https://infographics.economist.com1","https://infographics.economist.com1"],"css":[]},"sectionArticles":[{"id":"/content/t5ovgcivebpsmnrmu19bggq43co95ndp","publication":[{"id":"/content/sl6sqo608pbsloq0752qjeepclu15bct","context":{"position":2000.72,"__typename":"Content"},"__typename":"Content"},{"id":"/content/upiv8faakrffsi4ar9nhd2amtlrvges5","context":{"position":2000.72,"__typename":"Content"},"__typename":"Content"},{"id":"/content/go51ge2gu5q77tuom4d28vgorm6hkus3","context":{"position":2000.72,"__typename":"Content"},"__typename":"Content"},{"id":"/content/0ucd5kje5o10oao57421nbnkrfuqegic","context":{"position":2000.72,"__typename":"Content"},"__typename":"Content"},{"id":"/content/ki5uam277luc46jm3vqb43dqn1kamsl6","context":{"position":2000.72,"__typename":"Content"},"__typename":"Content"},{"id":"/content/7lunr64s64p7tu6shm1b8gsun8h2koph","context":{"position":2000.72,"__typename":"Content"},"__typename":"Content"},{"id":"/content/vuh71rh0csb6tm4jmupadbpvo6b4j3qv","context":{"position":2000.72,"__typename":"Content"},"__typename":"Content"},{"id":"/content/9v6i222upo5e7ejakdf1qhb08mb4fri5","context":{"position":2000.72,"__typename":"Content"},"__typename":"Content"}],"headline":"Data from satellites suggest violence has surged in much of Sudan","url":{"canonical":"https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2023/07/20/data-from-satellites-suggest-violence-has-surged-in-much-of-sudan","__typename":"URL"},"__typename":"Content"}]},"cp2Content":{"id":"11af1ac9-c773-46fc-8d5b-2ff29175ff3e","tegId":"t5ovgcivebpsmnrmu19bggq43co95ndp","url":"/graphic-detail/2023/07/20/data-from-satellites-suggest-violence-has-surged-in-much-of-sudan","headline":"Data from satellites suggest violence has surged in much of Sudan","flyTitle":"Crescent of fire","rubric":"Throughout the south and in the capital, the number of fires detected from space is abnormally high","byline":null,"dateline":null,"layout":{"headerStyle":"STANDARD"},"brand":"ECONOMIST","dateModified":"2023-07-20T15:18:03.369Z","dateCreated":"2023-07-20T14:55:09.946Z","datePublished":"2023-07-20T15:16:48.000Z","dateFirstPublished":"2023-07-20T14:54:57.000Z","dateRevised":"2023-07-20T14:54:57.000Z","leadComponent":null,"body":[{"type":"UNKNOWN"},{"type":"PARAGRAPH","text":"Sudan’s civil war is thought to have uprooted at least 3m people.
