In the 45 years since Louise Brown, the first “test-tube baby”, was born, IVF has become the main treatment for infertility around the world. At least 12m people have been conceived in glassware. An ivf baby takes its first gulp of air roughly every 45 seconds.\nYet the process remains gruelling. All too often, the pain and the cost come to nothing. There were 770,000 ivf babies born in 2018, but some 3m cycles. In America and Britain roughly half of women in treatment go home with a baby in their arms, even after several years. But, as our Technology Quarterly reports, recent scientific work offers some hope, holding out more promise and less heartache for generations of parents to come.\n\nLeader: IVF is failing most women.
